  <p>
    A product can only be as great as the code it's written in. I have therefore always been involved in frontend development to ensure that the best possible experience gets delivered.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have extensive knowledge of web technologies and have produced both interactive prototypes and large scale client-side interfaces for a range of organisations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also lead, hired and trained frontend development teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    My experience includes:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li>
      Implementing moible-first responsive design
    </li>
    <li>
      Designing and implementing a scalable CSS framework using the principle of OOCSS
    </li>
    <li>
      Producing fully accessible experiences using progressive enhancement &amp; graceful degradation
    </li>
    <li>
      Building client-side applications using JS frameworks
    </li>
  </ul>
