    Providing an intuitive and engaging user experience is the most crucial aspect of creating a successful product.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have worked across the full spectrum of user centred design for internal teams, large organisations and public institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also lead design teams as well as trained others in using UX techniques and principles.
  </p>
  <p>
     My design process includes:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li>
      Stakeholder workshops
    </li>
    <li>
      Collaborative sketching
    </li>
    <li>
      Lean UX
    </li>
    <li>
      User research
    </li>
    <li>
      Information architecture
    </li>
    <li>
      Wireframing
    </li>
    <li>
      Prototyping
    </li>
    <li>
      User testing
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I believe that a great user experience is the responsibility of the whole team rather than just one person. I therefore foucs a lot of time on training others and getting everyone involved in the design process.
