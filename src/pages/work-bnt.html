  <h3>Brief</h3>
  <p>
    BraveNewTalent is an education tech startup aiming to make professional learning social. When I joined, they had just hired a lot of developers and had embarked on a significant pivot from being a social recruitment tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    My job was to help clarify the new idea into a cohesive product whilst ensuring all four of the agile development teams were producing features to a high standard.
  </p>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    Before embarking on this project, I felt we needed better insights into the behaviour and needs of our audience. Using a combination of user interviews and online surveys, I was able to quickly gather this information and identify our most important user groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowing it was impossible to do all the wireframing for four concurrent teams myself, I set about running internal sessions to teach the principles of great UX. I appointed one member of each team to ensure that the user journeys were being followed and that users needs were being met.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure quick feedback loops between the business and the developers, I ran collaborative design session at the start of each sprint with all key stakeholders. I also included developers in user testing session to see people's feedback directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    This allowed me to focus on the key user journeys and prototyping the most important  aspects of the new site.
  </p>
  <h3>Deliverables</h3>
  <p>
    My key deliverables were:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li>
      Prioritised list of user stories
    </li>
    <li>
      User journeys for all main user tasks
    </li>
    <li>
      Paper and HTML prototypes of key journeys
    </li>
    <li>
      User Testing evaluations of features
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    An example of the work produced can be seen in the following presentation:
