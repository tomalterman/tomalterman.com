    My talk at <a href="http://londonwebstandards.org/">London Web Standards</a>. We as developers are great at getting excited about ideas but can be bad at fleshing them out. That often leads to wasted effort or, worse, bad products. I show the power of sketching, how easy it is (regardless of drawing ability) and give a few tips on how to do it effectively to build great products quickly.
