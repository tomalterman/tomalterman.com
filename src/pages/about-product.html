    Providing an intuitive and engaging user experience is the most crucial aspect of creating a successful product or service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether for internal teams, large organisations or public institutions, I have worked across the full spectrum of user centred design, including:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li>
      Stakeholder workshops
    </li>
    <li>
      User research
    </li>
    <li>
      Information architecture
    </li>
    <li>
      Wireframing
    </li>
    <li>
      Prototyping
    </li>
    <li>
      User testing
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I believe however that a great user experience is the responsibility of the whole team rather than one person. I therefore spend a lot of my time getting everyone involved in the design process, providing insights from research or testing, as well as teaching the core principles of UX design.
