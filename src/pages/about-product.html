    Whilst working with product-focussed tech startups I have learnt the importance of a effective product management.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having been in charge of development and design teams, I have taken up more and more product management responsiblities to ensure that those teams work effectively and that we are always tackling the most important business problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    My experience includes:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li>
      Identifying the Minimum Viable Product
    </li>
    <li>
      Managing Agile developement projects
    </li>
    <li>
      Identifying and gathering effective business metrics and KPIs
    </li>
    <li>
      Writing effective user stories
    </li>
    <li>
      Developing and validating product hypotheses
    </li>
    <li>
      Data analysis
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I believe however that a great user experience is the responsibility of the whole team rather than one person. I therefore spend a lot of my time getting everyone involved in the design process, providing insights from research or testing, as well as teaching the core principles of UX design.
