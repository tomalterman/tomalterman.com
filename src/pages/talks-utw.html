    My talk at <a href="http://londonwebstandards.org/">Untangle the Web</a>. We as developers are great at getting excited about ideas but can be bad at fleshing them out, often leading to wasted effort, or worse, bad products. I'd like to show you the power of sketching, how easy it is (regardless of drawing ability) and give you a few tips on how to do it effectively to build great products quickly.
